        <item>I tried to make a copycat Popeyes® fried chicken sandwich and ended up with a hybrid between that and the one from Chick-fil-A®. So you get the best of both worlds and what\'s more, this DIY version never runs out, not even on Sundays.</item>
        <item>This is a very easy and no fail recipe for meatloaf. It won\'t take long to make at all, and it\'s quite good!</item>
        <item>It takes a little work, but it is worth it.</item>
        <item>My grandmother\'s recipe for roasted chicken. We are German and she used to do it this way all the time. I never have had a chicken this juicy before; this little trick works and makes the people eating it go silent. It\'s funny. We nibble on the celery after.</item>
        <item>I am a salmon lover. This is a great recipe for a slightly exotic flavor of Indian inspiration with a maple twist. The flavor is exceptional, delicious, and unique. Orange zest may be added for an extra flavor twist.</item>
        <item>A chicken curry with the balanced elements of spicy and sour with the traditional flavors of Southeast Asia. Serve with basmati rice. This will taste even better if you leave it for a day or two before eating.</item>
        <item>Spicy and flavorful vegan korma made in an Instant Pot®. There is a bit of preparation as with any korma, but cooking time is reduced, which helps free up time in the kitchen as well as saving the integrity of the ingredients. The result is a dish with larger pieces of vegetables you can sink your teeth into. This is best served with naan bread or brown basmati rice.</item>
